=======
- upgrade kruntime to dmd v2.056 (please remember to use the same version of phobos when trying to compile phobos for the kernel)
- Compile libdruntime.a with newlib
- Link kernel with libdruntime.d and remove the _Dmodule_ref kludge
- Reimplement all C files in D
- Once we have a working bare kernel using druntime + newlib rework the druntime to remove the need for an underlying C library.

 REJECTED
==========

1. Change code in update_image.sh and run_bochs.sh so that root previleges are not required. REASON: This is by design, non root users cannot mount loopback devices in linux.

1. Directory structure reorg.
